    <pre id="storytext">Ruby sat at the reading table, her comic book open in front of her. But she wasn’t really reading. Her eyes kept flicking toward the tall man in the suit.
Mr. Wolfe pretended to browse, pulling books from the shelves and flipping through them quickly. He smiled whenever Grandma glanced his way, but Ruby noticed something important—he never actually read a single page. His eyes were always drifting back to the glass case in the middle of the shop.
Ruby whispered, “Grandma, he’s not here for stories. He keeps staring at the case.”

Grandma adjusted her glasses and gave a small nod. “I see it too. Let’s stay calm. We’ll watch and wait.”

Ruby pulled her hood up like a cape. She wanted to look brave, even though her heart was thumping. She pretended to study her comic, but she angled it so she could see Wolfe’s reflection in the glass case.

Sure enough, he circled closer. He bent down as if to tie his shoe, but his hand brushed against the lock. Ruby’s stomach tightened.
He’s pretending to be a customer, she thought. But he’s really after Grandma’s book.

Ruby knew she had to act. She slipped her phone out of her pocket and held it low, snapping a quick picture of Wolfe near the case. Then she typed a short message to the neighborhood watch group: "Suspicious man in Grandma’s shop. Please come quickly."

She hit send and tucked her phone away.

Now it was a waiting game. Ruby’s eyes stayed sharp, her hoodie pulled tight. She was ready.</pre>
