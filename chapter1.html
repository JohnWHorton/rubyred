    <pre id="storytext">Ruby Carter was twelve years old, and everyone called her Red. It wasn’t just because of her bright fiery hair, it was because of the hoodie she wore every single day. The hoodie was soft, cozy, and the color of a ripe apple. Red loved it so much that she felt braver whenever she pulled the hood up, like a superhero putting on her cape.

Red lived in Harlem with her mom, but her favorite place in the whole city was Grandma’s bookshop in Brooklyn. The shop was magical. It smelled of old paper and cocoa, and every shelf seemed to whisper stories waiting to be discovered. Grandma Carter was strong, cheerful, and clever. She didn’t just sell books—she protected them, especially the rare ones that were too valuable to lose.

One chilly evening, Red zipped up her hoodie and slung her backpack over her shoulder. Inside were her comics, a notebook, and a snack for the subway ride.
“Remember, Ruby,” her mom said as she handed her a MetroCard, “stick to the main route, don’t talk to strangers, and keep your phone charged.”
“I know, Mom,” Red said with a grin. “I’ll be fine. I’m going to Grandma’s.”

Her mom kissed her forehead. “That hoodie makes you look fearless. But remember—being careful is just as important as being brave.”
Red nodded, tugged her hood up, and stepped out into the busy New York streets. Cars honked, people hurried past, and the city lights flickered like stars. She felt a little thrill in her chest. Tonight, she was off on an adventure—not through a forest, but through the concrete jungle of New York City.

She loved visiting Grandma’s bookshop in Brooklyn...</pre>
