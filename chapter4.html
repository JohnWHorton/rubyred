    <pre id="storytext">Mr. Wolfgang Wolfe strolled slowly through Grandma’s bookshop, his shiny shoes clicking softly on the wooden floor. He smiled as if he were just another customer, but Ruby kept her eyes on him.

He picked up a book from the shelf and flipped through the pages. “Ah, fascinating,” he said in a smooth voice. “You have quite the collection here.”
Grandma nodded politely. “We do. Stories from every corner of the world. Feel free to browse.”

Wolfe moved from shelf to shelf, pretending to admire the books. But Ruby noticed something strange. He wasn’t really reading. His eyes kept flicking toward the tall glass case in the middle of the shop. Inside was Grandma’s most valuable treasure—the centuries‑old book with golden letters on its cover.
Ruby whispered, “He’s pretending, Grandma. He keeps looking at the case.”

Grandma adjusted her glasses and gave a small nod. “I see it too. Stay sharp, Ruby.”

Wolfe circled closer, pretending to tie his shoe near the case. His hand brushed against the lock as if by accident. Ruby’s heart thumped. She pulled her hood up like a cape and pretended to read her comic, but she was really watching his reflection in the glass.

The shop was quiet, except for the sound of Wolfe’s footsteps. 

Ruby knew he wasn’t here for stories—he was here for something else.</pre>
