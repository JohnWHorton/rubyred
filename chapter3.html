      id="storytext">Ruby hurried down the busy Brooklyn street, her red hoodie glowing under the streetlights. She felt safer the moment she saw the familiar sign swinging above the door: Carter’s Bookshop.

The bell jingled as she stepped inside. Warm light spilled across the shelves, and the smell of cocoa and old paper wrapped around her like a hug.
“Ruby!” Grandma called from behind the counter. She wore her reading glasses low on her nose and had a stack of books beside her. “You’re just in time. I’ve got hot chocolate waiting.”

Red grinned, dropping her backpack. “Perfect. The subway was crowded tonight.”
Grandma chuckled. “That’s New York for you. But here, it’s always calm.”

In the center of the shop stood a tall glass case. Inside was Grandma’s most valuable treasure—a centuries‑old book with golden lettering on its cover. Grandma had told Ruby many times: “This book holds secrets of the city’s past. It must always stay safe.”

Ruby glanced at it now, proud that her grandma was the guardian of something so special.

Just then, the bell jingled again. A tall man in a sharp suit stepped inside. Ruby’s heart skipped—she recognized him. It was the man from the subway.
He smiled politely. “Good evening. What a wonderful shop you have here. May I browse?”
Grandma, always welcoming, nodded. “Of course. Feel free to look around. We love curious readers.”

Ruby tugged at her hoodie. She didn’t like the way his eyes flicked around the shop, especially toward the glass case. She whispered to herself, Stay sharp, Ruby. Something isn’t right.</pre>
