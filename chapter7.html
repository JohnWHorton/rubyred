    <pre id="storytext">The shop was quiet except for the soft creak of the floorboards as Mr. Wolfe circled closer to the glass case. Ruby’s heart pounded. She knew help was on the way, but would it arrive in time?

Just as Wolfe bent down again, the bell above the door jingled.

“Evening, Grandma Carter!” called Mrs. Lopez, the friendly baker from next door. She carried a basket of fresh rolls.

Behind her came Mr. Singh, the corner store owner, with a bag of fruit. And right after them stepped Officer Daniels, the neighborhood policeman, tipping his cap.
Ruby’s phone buzzed in her pocket. Her message had worked—the neighbors were here.

Wolfe straightened up quickly, startled by the sudden crowd. His sly smile flickered.

Grandma folded her arms. “Looking for something special, sir?” she asked firmly.

Ruby pulled her hood up like a cape and stepped forward. “Or were you just pretending to browse?”
