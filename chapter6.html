    <pre id="storytext">Ruby’s heart thumped as she watched Mr. Wolfe circle closer to the glass case. He bent down again, pretending to tie his shoe, but this time she saw something glint in his hand—a tiny tool, like a pick.

He’s going to try the lock, Ruby thought.

She pulled her hood up tight, like a superhero cape, and slipped her phone out of her pocket. Holding it low, she snapped another picture. Then she quickly typed a message to the neighborhood watch group: "Suspicious man in Grandma’s shop. Please come quickly."

She pressed send and tucked her phone away.

Grandma kept busy at the counter, stacking books, but Ruby could tell she was watching too. Her eyes flicked toward Wolfe, sharp behind her glasses.

Mr. Wolfe straightened up, pretending to admire a book on the shelf. “Such rare treasures you have here,” he said smoothly. “I’ve never seen a shop quite like this.”

Ruby pretended to read her comic, but her eyes stayed locked on his reflection in the glass. She was ready. If he tried anything, she would catch him.
The shop was quiet, the air heavy with suspense. Ruby’s clever plan was in motion. 

Help was on the way.</pre>
