     <pre id="storytext">Mr. Wolfe’s sly smile faded as more neighbors stepped into the shop. The cozy little bookstore suddenly felt crowded, and all eyes were on him.
He tried to laugh it off. “Ah, such a popular place! I was only browsing, of course.”

But Ruby saw the small tool still hidden in his hand. She stepped forward, her red hood pulled up like a cape. “You weren’t browsing. You were trying to open the case.”

The neighbors gasped. Grandma folded her arms, her voice firm. “This shop is for readers, not thieves.”

Mr. Wolfe’s face turned pale. He backed toward the door, but Officer Daniels blocked his path. “That’s far enough, sir,” the officer said.

Wolfe looked around, trapped. His smooth words had failed, and his sneaky plan was ruined.

Mrs. Lopez shook her head. “Shame on you, trying to steal from Grandma Carter’s shop.”

Mr. Singh added, “Books belong to everyone. You can’t take them for yourself.”

Officer Daniels took Wolfe by the arm. “You’ll have to come with me.”

Ruby felt her heart slow down. The danger was over. Wolfe had been caught, and the book was safe.

Grandma smiled proudly at her granddaughter. “You were brave, Ruby. You saw through his disguise.”
Ruby grinned. “And we stopped him together.”</pre>
